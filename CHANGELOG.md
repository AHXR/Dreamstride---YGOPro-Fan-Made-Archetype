# 1.1 - The "Meta" Update (9/11/2017)

After further testing with this archetype against more meta decks, it seems that this deck is extremely behind. I've reworked some of the cards to make this deck seem
more like a competitor. Although that is the case, I also balanced some of the more powerful cards too.

* "to Dreamstride" cards text fixed. It should be: 
> "You cannot activate Spell Cards after you activate this card for the rest of the turn."

* Conscious' ability reworked and buffed. New effect: 
> You can discard this card to the Graveyard: Add 1 "Polymerization" from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand. When this card is Special Summoned: You can add 1 FAIRY monster from your Deck to your hand. When your opponent's monster declares a direct attack while this card is in your Graveyard: You can Special Summon this card from your Graveyard in face-up Defense Position. If Summoned this way, banish it when it leaves the field.

* Dreamstride - Prodromal is no longer a tuner monster and it's special summon effect can now target level 4 or lower FAIRY monsters.
* Dreamstride - Nightmare Inflicter's attack activation ability has been removed and replaced with something more relatable to the archetype:
> During damage calculation, in either player's turn: You can discard this card; you take no Battle Damage from that battle. If this card is in your Graveyard: You can Special Summon this card. You must control a Tuner monster to activate and to resolve this effect.

* Dreamstride - Witch's special summon ability has been removed and has been further reworked:
> When this card is sent to the Graveyard: Target 1 card in either player's Graveyard, except "Dreamstride - Witch"; shuffle that target into the deck. You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material Monster, but the other Fusion Material Monster(s) must be correct.

* Dreamstride - Connection Inflicter's ATK has been reduced (2500-1500)
* All Dreamstride FUSION monsters have been given a new effect:
> If this card is used for a Synchro Summon and sent to the Graveyard: draw 1 card.

* Dreamstride - Unconscious Beast reworked:
> You can banish this card from your Graveyard to target 1 FAIRY-Type Monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon it. You cannot Special Summon for the rest of the turn.

* Dreamstride - Insomnia has been given an additional effect:
> You can discard 1 card to Special Summon this card from your hand. When this card is Special Summoned: You can add 1 FAIRY-Type monster from your Deck to your hand. If this card is sent to the Graveyard for the Synchro Summon of a LIGHT Synchro Monster, you can destroy 1 Spell or Trap Card. 

* Dreamstride - Solid Soul has been given an additional effect:
> When a Level 3 or lower monster(s) is Special Summoned (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from hand. During the End Phase, if this card is in the Graveyard because it was destroyed on the field and sent there this turn: You can add 1 FAIRY-Type monster from your Deck to your hand. If this card is sent to the Graveyard for a Synchro Summon or Fusion Summon of a FAIRY monster, draw 1 card.
