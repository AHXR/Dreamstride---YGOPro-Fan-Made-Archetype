Dreamstride is a fan-made archetype that was created for YGOPro. This archetype contains a list of FAIRY monsters and works together with fusion monsters to form powerful Synchro monsters. 

I've tested these cards against several decks, even those currently in the meta. Below are the strengths and weaknesses I've personally discovered from playing with these cards. These cards are still a WIP, therefore I have not 
exported the cards through the card manager yet. 

# Strengths & Weaknesses

## Strengths
- Quick and easy special summon combinations
- Works well with other fusion support cards
- Can be played with other FAIRY archetypes
- Can control the direction of a duel early on
- Swarms the field pretty well
- Can be used to lockdown an enemy.

## Weaknesses
- Little to no recovery tactics
- Lockdown cards destroy this archetype
- Weak monsters that cannot stall
- "to Dreamstride" cards can be used to the opponent's benefit
- Synchro monsters require fusion monster material.

To basically sum this up: Dreamstride is pretty good at Special Summoning monsters and swarming the field early-mid way into a duel. However if a combination gets countered, there is little chance of the player recovering
from that. The monster cards alone have an issue stalling for more time. They all lack attack and defense, which plays a huge part in today's meta. Although that is the case, if the controller takes advantage of swarming
the field and performs combinations correctly: The controller can either lockdown the opponent or snowball with a few cards. The continous spell cards "to Dreamstride" are very powerful cards, HOWEVER, they cannot be searched
and only 1 of each is allowed to be on the field at the same time. Those cards can also become a disadvantage because the opposing player can take advantage of the effects as well.

Some of the card limitations are crippling and I designed the deck like that for a reason. As you may have noticed, some of the card texts are not the same as the effects you will see in YGOPro. Before some of the balance updates
some of these cards were snowballing very easily and it just extremely unfair, even for the meta.
